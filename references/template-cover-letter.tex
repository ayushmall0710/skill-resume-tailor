\textbf{Subject: Application for Data Scientist, Apps}

\vspace{1em}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the \textbf{Data Scientist, Apps} position at Apple. With over three years of experience spanning data engineering, applied machine learning, and product analytics, I bring a strong foundation in building scalable data systems and deriving insights that inform product growth and user engagement. Currently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Data Science at the University of Washington, where my work bridges statistical modeling, causal inference, and ML-driven experimentation.

At \textbf{Corvic AI}, I developed a multi-cloud ingestion framework (S3, Azure Blob, GCS) with Apache Iceberg to handle millions of data points and built LLM-powered data enrichment features enabling real-time insight generation. Previously at \textbf{Shell}, I led automation of emission analytics across five global data systems using Azure Databricks and Power BI, reducing reporting time by 97.85\% and driving sustainability-focused decisions. These experiences honed my ability to translate complex data into measurable business and product impact, aligning closely with Appleâ€™s focus on predictive behavior, lifecycle analytics, and user experience optimization.

I am particularly drawn to Appleâ€™s data-driven approach to building intuitive, human-centered products. The opportunity to apply advanced modeling, causal inference, and experimentation to optimize user engagement across the App ecosystem deeply resonates with both my technical expertise and my curiosity-driven approach to data science.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my analytical experience and product intuition can contribute to Appleâ€™s mission of creating transformative user experiences.
